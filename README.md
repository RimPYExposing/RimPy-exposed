RimPY is not to be trusted, they have once again completely wiped my concerns for this project off. And have deleted my Issue regarding it, and my repo containing it.
This is highly concerning sense I brought up the fact RimPY was making unneeded connections, and was also bringing up about open sourcing the code.
This will also be hosted on my personal website to ensure it's archived.

USE RIMSORT, SUPPORT OPEN SOURCE DEVELOPMENT
